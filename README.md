# DataScienceNotebook

Python data science code and notes for a [Data Science and Machine Learning course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) on Udemy.

This repository is mainly for my own safekeeping.

- Almost all of the comments are written by me
- Some code is modified by me from source code provided in the course
- Other sections, namely the exercise solutions were written from scratch by myself.
- Most of the code here was written by the [course author](https://www.udemy.com/user/frank-kane-2/).
